# ffmpeg-video-splitter
Splits a video (dragged and dropped onto the batch file) into equal segments (of default 55-60 seconds for instagram posts) in a container folder with custom name.

Make sure you have ffmpeg.exe usable in your system variables, or place ffmpeg.exe in the bat location folder and change the ffmpeg line of code to ffmpeg.exe
